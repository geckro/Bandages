# Bandages
Source code for the Bandages project.

## What is Bandages?
The Bandages project tries to aim for better cross-mod compatibility depending on which mods are loaded in tModLoader. It will try to do the following:

- If content mods are loaded, intertwine the recipes so that the mods feel like one mod.
- Add recipes and quality of life tweaks to the game, depending on what mods are loaded.
- If certain mods are loaded, tweak the values of items to feel more coherent.

## Why make this?
I decided to try and make this mod to get back into modding tModLoader again and I felt like nothing was intertwined and mods had no purpose together. Usually, you aren't meant to mix content mods. But what if you want to? A lot of people do, especially with the removal of the 4GiB limit.
